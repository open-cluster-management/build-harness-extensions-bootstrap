# Build Harness Bootstrap

This repo contains a thin makefile that simply pulls our fork of [build-harness](https://github.com/stolostron/build-harness) and our [build-harness-extensions](https://github.com/stolostron/build-harness-extensions) using the method documented in the [build-harness-extensions readme](https://github.com/stolostron/build-harness-extensions#extensions-to-build-harness).  

## Use

Invoke `make` in the root directory of this project to pull the build harness and build harness extensions.  From there, you'll be able to access the build harness fully!
